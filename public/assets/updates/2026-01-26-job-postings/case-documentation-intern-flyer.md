# Case Documentation Intern

## About Jawafdehi

**Building Nepal's Institutional Memory Against Corruption**

At _jawafdehi.org_, we're creating an open database of corruption cases for Nepal, making allegations, evidence, and outcomes accessible to citizens. Born out of the GenZ mandate to end the culture of corruption in Nepal, Jawafdehi will remain a civic tech accountability platform, directly challenging [CIAA](ciaa.gov.np) and the rest of Nepal's public accountability system.

Join us in documenting corruption and strengthening accountability through rigorous research and structured data.

See example cases:
- Rabi Lamichhane cooperative fraud: https://beta.jawafdehi.org/case/207
- Giri Bandhu land swap scandal: https://beta.jawafdehi.org/case/175
